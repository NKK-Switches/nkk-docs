## Firmware Overview

The firmware is written such that it is easy to modify or add features. Only basic features are implemented in the factory default to keep the firmware easy to follow. As such it is not optimized. For example, the current firmware can send about 10 frames of Frameless OLED images per second. With the same controller, it is possible to send about 50 frames per second.

OLED Rocker is controlled independently of the color OLED versions and has its own set of attributes.

All OLEDs have the same on-board controller. However, they have different initializations and pixel fields. A code, (Eng Kit code), set in the firmware, specifies the type of OLED product at each position. This code determines that each position is initialized with the proper OLED initialization and images for the associated OLED product.

<div id="dev-kit-code" style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>
  <div style={{ fontStyle: "italic", marginBottom: "8px" }}>Eng kit codes:</div>  
</div>

| Eng Kit         | Switches                                  | Code |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---- |
| IS-ENG-KIT-7-FF | Frameless switch 1 and Frameless switch 2 | 00H  |
| IS-ENG-KIT-7-FS | Frameless switch 1 and Standard switch 2  | 01H  |
| IS-ENG-KIT-7-DS | Display switch 1 and Standard switch 2    | 02H  |
| IS-ENG-KIT-8-R  | Rocker switch                             | 03H  |

It is very important to have this code correct as wrong initialization can damage the OLED product. This code is saved in the EEPROM of the microcontroller. If the EEPROM of the microcontroller has not been programmed, the default value from firmware code is saved to the EEPROM and used (found in the GetCurrentDevKit() function) which is 00H. Make sure that when modifying the firmware that the default code in the firmware is selected to match the Engineering Kit in use.

The firmware communicates to a host computer via RS232 to USB. Any data sent from the host are received via interrupt and placed in a receive buffer. The data get processed in the main program. Any transmit datum is put in a transmit buffer. Each timer interrupt transmits a byte from the transmit buffer if it is not empty. The firmware also handles read and write operations from and to the external flash memory, as well as controls the color OLEDs and the OLED Rocker. The communication protocol is outlined in following sections.

The 16M flash memory is a NOR flash and as such, when writing to the memory, it can only turn an ON cell to the OFF state. The erase command turns all the cells to the ON state. If images or other data on the flash memory needs to be changed then it is required that the erase command be sent first. The flash memory has partial erase commands available, however, as of the first firmware release date only the complete erase is implemented in the firmware.

The 7 I/O pins in the auxiliary port are initialized as inputs with weak pull-ups. These pins can be used to sense or control in user-defined custom applications.

The flash memory is set up to save up to 511 images and attributes each for all 4 switch types (Frameless, Standard, Display, Rocker). Two bytes are needed to address an image or attributes.

Each switch has an associated active Attribute Block in the RAM. Additionally each switch is associated to an active display address. If the system detects an image needs changing, the image from the flash memory address of the active address is transferred to the switch .

An address is assigned to a switch via switch press, timer expiration, or upon power-up. Before an address is assigned to a switch, the controller checks the Attribute Block in the flash at the assigned address. If the first two bytes are equal to the assigned address, the Attribute Block from flash is loaded to the active Attribute Block. After loading, the active display is loaded based on the attributes. If Timer1 does not equal zero, the loop timer starts running. If the first two bytes of the attribute block are not equal to the assigned address, no action is taken.

If Timer1 does not equal zero, a loop timer is started. The loop timer is calculated by multiplying Timer1 and Timer2. When the loop timer expires the displayed address is compared to the End Address. If they are equal, and the jump addresses for SW1/SW2 do not equal zero, then the jump addresses become the new active addresses for switch1 and switch2. Then the attributes and images are loaded accordingly. If the jump addresses of SW1/SW2 are equal to zero, there is no change to the active addresses and the loop restarts for the associated switch. If the displayed address and the End Address are not equal, then the displayed address + 1 is loaded as the displayed address and the image is sent to the switch. The loop timer then restarts.

When a switch is pressed, if the press addresses for SW1/SW2 of the active Attribute Block are not equal to zero they become the active addresses for switch1 and switch2, and are sent to the switches. If the press addresses of SW1/SW2 are equal to zero, there will not be any update or change to the active addresses.

## Operational Overview

### Power-up Sequence  
Upon power-up the controller executes the following steps and then enters the main program.
1. Initializes all the active attributes blocks to zero.
2. Checks the current Eng Kit setup. If not set, defaults to two frameless switches and saves to EEPROM.
3. Sets the active address of switch#1 and the OLED rocker to 0001H (if applicable).
4. Checks the active address of switch #2 and the brightness from the setup attribute. If there is no setup attribute it defaults to address 0002H and maximum brightness (0FH).
5. Loads the attributes for both switches into memory.
6. Sends the active images to the switches.
7. Set the timer interrupt for every 0.5ms.
8. Set up the UART (RS232) communication.
9. Transmit 11H to host.

### OLED Color Main Program  
The main program continuously goes through the following steps:
1. Check and execute commands if there are data in the RS232 receive buffer.
2. If the flag for switch scan is set, scan the switches and set flags.
3. If switch #1 timer has expired, the timer is stopped, report 83H and process according to the active attribute of the switch#1.
4. If switch #2 timer has expired, the timer is stopped, report 84H and process according to the active attribute of the switch#2.
5. If switch#1 is pressed, report 81H and process according to the active attribute of the switch#1.
6. If switch#2 is pressed, report 82H and process according to the active attribute of the switch#2.
7. If switch#1 is released, report C1H.
8. If switch#2 is released report C2H.
9. If switch#1 image changes, report FFH followed by switch#1 active address and update the memory for switch#1 with image from flash at the active address for the switch#1. Starts timer for switch#1 if timer 1 is non-zero.
10. If switch#2 image changes, report FEH followed by switch#2 active address and update the memory for switch#2 with image from flash at the active address for the switch#2. Starts timer for switch#2 if timer 1 is non-zero.
11. Go to step1.

### Rocker Main Program
The main program continuously goes through the following steps:
1. Check and execute commands if there are data in the RS232 receive buffer.
2. If the flag for switch scan is set, scan the switches and set flags.
3. If the switch timer has expired, the timer is stopped, report 83H and process according to the active attribute of the switch.
4. If the top switch is pressed, report 91H and process according to the active attribute of the switch.
5. If the middle switch is pressed, report 92H and process according to the active attribute of the switch.
6. If the bottom switch is pressed, report 93H and process according to the active attribute of the switch.
7. If the top switch is released, report B1H.
8. If the middle switch is released report B2H.
9. If the bottom switch is released report B3H.
10. If the switch image changes, report FDH followed by the switch active address and update the memory for the switch with image from flash at the active address for the switch. Starts timer for the switch if timer 1 is non-zero.
11. Go to step1.

### Timer-Interrupt  
Timer-interrupt is set for every 0.5ms.  It does the following functions:
1. Increment the master half millisecond timer that the main program uses for all timers. All timers use this for a starting time and to check if the stop time has passed.
2.	If the RS232 transmit buffer is not empty, transmit a byte.
3.	Exit the interrupt.

## Communication Protocol

The controller communicates with the host via USB serial communication (115.2K, 1 start bit, 8 bit, 1 stop bit).

**Communication Initiated by the Controller**:  
The controller transmits the switch activities, timer expirations, and the addresses of images when they are displayed. The protocol for the code transmitted are explained in the Main Program in the Operational Overview.

**Communication Initiated by the Host**:  
The controller receives the data via a serial interrupt routine that places the data in the circular receive buffer. When the controller detects data in the circular receive buffer in the main program, the controller reads one byte and executes according to the following scenario.

1. If the byte is 01H the controller responds by putting 61H in the transmit buffer and exits.
2. If the byte is a 20H to 2FH the controller responds by putting 61H in the transmit buffer. The controller checks the command procedure and processes it accordingly. If the command procedure exists and all the data is proper, the controller puts 79H in the transmit buffer and exits. If the command procedure does not exist, the data is not acceptable, or consecutive bytes are not received within 100ms then the controller puts 6EH in the transmit buffer and exits.
3. If the byte is not 01H, or 20H to 2FH, it is ignored.

## Commands to the Controller

There are two formats to transmit data:
1. **Hex format**: A hex byte is transmitted without any change to it. 
[xxH] will be used to denote this.
All commands and some data are sent by using this format.

2. **ASCII HEX format**: Each nibble of the byte is converted to ASCII code and sent as a byte. 
[xxAH xxAH] will be used to denote this.
For example, the hex byte 5AH is transmitted in two bytes, 35H and 41H. The ASCII value for 5 is 35H and the ASCII value for A is 41H.
All addresses and most data are sent using this format.

## Hardware Considerations

The power can be supplied to the Engineering Kits via USB port or J2 header. The voltage range can be 4.5V to 5.5V. Maximum current consumption is 125mA. A fuse and a Zener diode are used for high voltage input protection.

The PIC18F46K40 microcontroller is used in the Engineering Kits. The VDD for the microcontroller is 3.3V. A reset chip at the location PC1 is implemented to reset the microcontroller at 2.9V to comply with the OLED switch turn OFF requirement. Once the voltage gets to the 2.9V the microcontroller is reset causing the charge pump circuit disabling the OLED voltage. The OLED logic voltage is acceptable till 2.4V. The charge pump provides the OLED voltage and it is normally disabled with a pull-down resistor on the enable pin. The microcontroller enables it by setting the enable pin to high.

The auxiliary ports I/O are directly connected to microcontroller pins without any safety circuits. Care must be taken not to exceed VDD voltage.

## Programming Setup

The Engineering Kits are designed to be easily programmed and have a 5-position SIP footprint for this purpose (JP1). They can be programed by a variety of different programmers. Our recommendation is to use the PICkit 3 with the IS-PA2 adaptor and a USB power source. The IS-PA2 is an adaptor with a 5-position SIP header on one side and a 5-position, spring-loaded header on the other side.

<Aside type="caution" title="Caution">
    Position 1 of the PICKIT3 must be at position 1 on the PCB or damage could occur. The 5V power must be supplied, usually through the USB cable although there are through-hole pads on the PCB for an alternative 5V power connection.

## Key Terms & Definitions

**Host**  
Any computer, terminal, or other device that can communicate over the USB line.

**Byte**  
An eight-bit hex value ranging from 00H to FFH (Decimal 0 to 255). The bit format of a byte is: (B7 B6 B5 B4 B3 B2 B1 B0) where B7 is most significant and bit B0 is least significant bit.

**Nibble/Hex Digit**  
A four-bit value ranging from 0H to FH. A byte consists of two nibbles.

**ASCII**  
A byte value representing a symbol.

**Communication Format**  
There are two formats to transmit a byte:

1. **Hex format** - A hex byte is transmitted without any change to it. [**xxH**] will be used to denote this.

    All commands and some data are sent by using this format.

2. **ASCII HEX format** - Each nibble of the byte is converted to ASCII code and sent as a byte. [**xxAH**] will be used to denote this.

    For example, the hex byte 5AH is transmitted in two bytes, 35H and 41H. The ASCII value for 5 is 35H and the ASCII value for A is 41H.

    All addresses and most data are sent using this format.

**Address**  
A two-byte value ranging from 0001H to 07FFH representing the 2,047 memory locations for pictures and attributes on the flash memory.
