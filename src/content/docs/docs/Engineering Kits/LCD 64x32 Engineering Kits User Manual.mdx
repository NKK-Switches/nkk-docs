## Possible Engineering Kits Using the S02G1 Controller

Many Engineering Kits can be made with the S02G1 controller simply by soldering on various sockets (table below). The LCD 64x32 Pushbutton and Compact Pushbutton both have the same pinout footprint and use the same socket. All the Engineering Kits come with switches/display on the sockets and a USB cable. Controlling all the LCD 64x32 kits is the same.

## Firmware Overview

The firmware is written such that it is easy to modify or add features. Only basic features are implemented in the factory default to keep the firmware easy to follow. As such it is not optimized.

There is no difference in controlling the various LCD 64x32 switches/display. The LCD 64x32 switch handles refreshing the LCD and controlling the LED backlight colors via the internal controller. There are no requirements for initialization or refreshing for the LCD 64x32. The LCD 64x32 powers up with the LCD OFF, the backlight OFF, and at the lowest brightness level. There are no limitations as to when the LCD image, backlight color, or brightness level can be changed. Any changes made to the LCD image, backlight color, or brightness level stay in effect until reboot or power down.

The firmware communicates to a host computer via RS232 through USB. Any data sent from the host are received via interrupt and placed in a receive buffer. The data get processed in the main program. Any transmit datum is put in a transmit buffer. Each timer interrupt transmits a byte from the transmit buffer if it is not empty. The firmware also handles read and write operations from and to the external flash memory, as well as controls the two LCD switches. The communication protocol is outlined in following sections.

The 1M flash memory is a NOR flash and as such, when writing to the memory, it can only turn an ON cell to the OFF state. The erase command turns all the cells to the ON state. If images or other data on the flash memory need to be changed then it is required that the erase command be sent first. The flash memory has partial erase commands available, however, as of the first firmware release date only the complete erase is implemented in the firmware.

The 7 I/O pins in the auxiliary port are initialized as inputs with weak pull-ups. These pins can be used to sense or control in user-defined custom applications.

The flash memory is set up to save up to 2047 images and attributes. Two bytes are needed to address an image or attribute block.

| Address | LCD64x32 |                 |     |
| ------- | -------- | --------------- | --- |
| 0001    | Image    | Attribute Block |
| 0002    | Image    | Attribute Block |
| . . .   | Image    | Attribute Block |
| . . .   | Image    | Attribute Block |
| 07FE    | Image    | Attribute Block |
| 07FF    | Image    | Attribute Block |

Each image is 256 bytes and each Attribute Block is 16 bytes long. 

### Attribute Block

| Name           | Current address | End address for the loop | Timer1 for the loop | Timer2 for the loop | Next address for SW1 upon switch press | Next address for SW2 upon switch press | Jump address for SW1 at the end of the loop | Jump address for SW2 at the end of the loop | LED color code for ON-cycle | LED color code for OFF-cycle |
| -------------- | --------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Range**      | 0000 to 07FF    | 0000 to 07FF             | 00 to FF            | 00 to FF            | 0000 to 07FF                           | 0000 to 07FF                           | 0000 to 07FF                                | 0000 to 07FF                                | LED code                    | LED code                     |
| **# of bytes** | 2               | 2                        | 1                   | 1                   | 2                                      | 2                                      | 2                                           | 2                                           | 1                           | 1                            |

Each switch has an associated active Attribute Block in the RAM. Additionally, each switch is associated to an active display address and active backlight codes. If the system detects that an image needs changing, the image from the flash memory address of the active address is transferred to the switch. If the system detects that the backlight timer has expired, the LED backlights change according to the ON/OFF cycle of the currently displayed backlight address.

An address is assigned to a switch via switch press, timer expiration, or upon power-up. Before an address is assigned to a switch, the controller checks the Attribute Block in the flash at the assigned address. If the first two bytes are equal to the assigned address, the Attribute Block from flash is loaded to the active Attribute Block. After loading, the active LED code and active display are loaded based on the attributes. If Timer1 does not equal zero, the loop timer starts running. If the first two bytes of the attribute block are not equal to the assigned address, no action is taken.

If Timer1 does not equal zero, a loop timer is started. The loop timer is calculated by multiplying Timer1 and Timer2. When the loop timer expires the displayed address is compared to the End Address. If they are equal, and the jump addresses for SW1/SW2 do not equal zero, then the jump addresses become the new active addresses for switch1 and switch2. Then the attributes and images are loaded accordingly. If the jump addresses of SW1/SW2 are equal to zero, there is no change to the active addresses and the loop restarts for the associated switch. If the displayed address and the End Address are not equal, then the displayed address + 1 is loaded as the displayed address and the image is sent to the switch. The loop timer then restarts. When a new displayed address is loaded, the backlight LED codes for that address are sent to the switch.

When a switch is pressed, if the press addresses for SW1/SW2 of the active Attribute Block are not equal to zero they become the active addresses for switch1 and switch2, and are sent to the switches. If the press addresses of SW1/SW2 are equal to zero, there will not be any update or change to the active addresses.
 
The backlight code has 2 bits for each color according to the switch specification.

### Backlight LED Code

| Switch/Display Type | Code  |       |       |           |
| ------------------- | ----- | ----- | ----- | --------- |
| RGB switch/display  | RED   | GREEN | BLUE  | Must be 1 |  |
| Bits                | B7 B6 | B5 B4 | B3 B2 | B1 B0     |
| Possible values     | 0/1   | 0/1   | 0/1   | 1         |

The controller alternates between the ON and OFF codes every second.

## Operational Overview

### Power-up Sequence  
Upon power-up the controller executes the following 7 steps and then enters the main program.
1. Initializes the active attribute blocks for both switches to zero.   
2. Set 0001H address to switch#1, set 0002H address to switch#2, and initialize all the active backlight codes to white.   
3. Check the setup values from flash memory and if valid, change the active address for switch#2.   
4. Check the Attribute Blocks from the flash memory and if valid, load them to the active Attribute Blocks in the RAM.
5. Set the timer-interrupt for every 0.5ms.
6. Set up the UART (RS232) communication.
7. Transmit 11H to host.

### Main Program  
The main program continuously goes through the following steps:
1. Check and execute commands if there is data in the RS232 receive buffer.
2. If the time for switch scan is expired: Scan the switches for being pressed.
3. If switch #1 timer has expired: The timer is stopped, then report 83H and process according to the active attribute of switch#1.
4. If switch #2 timer has expired: The timer is stopped, then report 84H and process according to the active attribute of switch#2.
5. If switch#1 is pressed: Report 81H and process according to the active attribute of the switch#1.
6. If switch#2 is pressed: Report 82H and process according to the active attribute of the switch#2.
7. If switch#1 is released: Report C1H.  
8. If switch#2 is released: Report C2H.  
9. If switch#1 image changes: Report FFH followed by the switch#1 active address and update the memory for switch#1 with the active address image from the flash for switch#1. Start timer for switch#1 if Timer1 is non-zero.
10. If switch#2 image changes: Report FEH followed by the switch#2 active address and update the memory for switch#2 with the active address image from the flash for switch#2. Start timer for switch#2 if Timer1 is non-zero.
11.	If the backlight timer has expired: The switch#1 backlight is updated with the active backlight code for switch#1 and according to the ON/OFF cycle and the switch#2 backlight is updated with the active backlight code for switch#2 and according to the ON/OFF cycle.
12.	Go to step 1.

### Timer-Interrupt  
Timer-interrupt is set for every 0.5ms.  It does the following functions:
1. Increment the master half millisecond timer that the main program uses for all timers. All timers use this for a starting time and to check if the stop time has passed.
2.	If the RS232 transmit buffer is not empty, transmit a byte.
3.	Exit the interrupt.

## Communication Protocol

The controller communicates with the host via USB serial communication (115.2K, 1 start bit, 8 bit, 1 stop bit).

**Communication Initiated by the Controller**:  
The controller transmits the switch activities, timer expirations, and the addresses of images when they are displayed. The protocol for the code transmitted are explained in the Main Program in the Operational Overview.

**Communication Initiated by the Host**:  
The controller receives the data via a serial interrupt routine that places the data in the circular receive buffer. When the controller detects data in the circular receive buffer in the main program, the controller reads one byte and executes according to the following scenario.

1. If the byte is 01H the controller responds by putting 61H in the transmit buffer and exits.
2. If the byte is a 20H to 2FH the controller responds by putting 61H in the transmit buffer. The controller checks the command procedure and processes it accordingly. If the command procedure exists and all the data is proper, the controller puts 79H in the transmit buffer and exits. If the command procedure does not exist, the data is not acceptable, or consecutive bytes are not received within 100ms then the controller puts 6EH in the transmit buffer and exits.
3. If the byte is not 01H, or 20H to 2FH, it is ignored.

## Commands to the Controller

There are two formats to transmit data:
1. **Hex format**: A hex byte is transmitted without any change to it. 
[xxH] will be used to denote this.
All commands and some data are sent by using this format.

2. **ASCII HEX format**: Each nibble of the byte is converted to ASCII code and sent as a byte. 
[xxAH xxAH] will be used to denote this.
For example, the hex byte 5AH is transmitted in two bytes, 35H and 41H. The ASCII value for 5 is 35H and the ASCII value for A is 41H.
All addresses and most data are sent using this format.

#### Commands that Disable Switch and Timer Execution

Upon transmitting any of the following commands, the timers stop running and attributes for the switches activity do not execute. However, the switches are still scanned and reported. The attributes execution is enabled upon reboot or power-up. The reason for disabling the attribute execution is to enable faster downloads of images and attributes.

#### Command to Disable Switch and Timer Execution

> This command disable switch and timer execution.

> The controller transmits the 16 bytes Attribute Block via RS232 in ASCII HEX format.

## Hardware Considerations

The power can be supplied to the Engineering Kits via USB port or the J2 header. The voltage range can be 4.5V to 5.5V. Maximum current consumption is 100mA. A fuse and a Zener diode are used for high voltage input protection.

The PIC18F46K40 microcontroller is used in the Engineering Kits. The VDD for the microcontroller is 3.3V. 
The 5V for the LCD 64x32 switches is provided using a charge pump. The reason for using a charge pump is because the USB power specification is from 4.5V to 5.5V, and because the LCD 64x32 voltage range is much tighter, from 4.9V to 5.1V.

The auxiliary ports I/O are directly connected to microcontroller pins without any safety circuits. Care must be taken not to exceed the VDD voltage.

## Programming Setup

The Engineering Kits are designed to be easily programmed and have a 5-position SIP footprint for this purpose (JP1). They can be programed by a variety of different programmers. Our recommendation is to use the PICkit 3 with the IS-PA2 adaptor and a USB power source. The IS-PA2 is an adaptor with a 5-position SIP header on one side and a 5-position, spring-loaded header on the other side.

<Aside type="caution" title="Caution">
    Position 1 of the PICKIT3 must be at position 1 on the PCB or damage could occur. The 5V power must be supplied, usually through the USB cable although there are through-hole pads on the PCB for an alternative 5V power connection.

## Key Terms & Definitions

**Host**  
Any computer, terminal, or other device that can communicate over the USB line.

**Byte**  
An eight-bit hex value ranging from 00H to FFH (Decimal 0 to 255). The bit format of a byte is: (B7 B6 B5 B4 B3 B2 B1 B0) where B7 is most significant and bit B0 is least significant bit.

**Nibble/Hex Digit**  
A four-bit value ranging from 0H to FH. A byte consists of two nibbles.

**ASCII**  
A byte value representing a symbol.

**Communication Format**  
There are two formats to transmit a byte:

1. **Hex format** - A hex byte is transmitted without any change to it. [**xxH**] will be used to denote this.

	All commands and some data are sent by using this format.

2. **ASCII HEX format** - Each nibble of the byte is converted to ASCII code and sent as a byte. [**xxAH**] will be used to denote this.

	For example, the hex byte 5AH is transmitted in two bytes, 35H and 41H. The ASCII value for 5 is 35H and the ASCII value for A is 41H.

	All addresses and most data are sent using this format.

**Address**  
A two-byte value ranging from 0001H to 07FFH representing the 2,047 memory locations for pictures and attributes on the flash memory.
