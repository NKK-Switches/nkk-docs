## General Features

The **Single Switch Solution** is a compact device that can both monitor and control an industrial process independently or in conjunction with other controllers.

The **IS-S0110-2** is a non-wireless alternative to the IS-S0110 Single Switch Solution. The main differences with this part number are:  
- No wireless functionality, suitable for applications that prohibit wireless communication.
- The onboard micro-controller is replaced with ESP32-PICO-V3-02.
- Two extra pins for UART TX and RX are on the unit.
- The web user interface used for the IS-S0110 is not compatible. 
- Programming is possible with the C++ source code which is available for customers.

The 36x24 pixel LCD display can display graphics or characters while the backlight color options allow for status color schemes and modes of operation. In addition to the on-board flash, there are two look-up fonts (5x7 and 7x10) on board to create images based on characters. Up to 3 lines of 6 characters in font 5x7 or up to 2 lines of 4 characters in font 7x10 can be displayed.

14 micro-controller pins are available for use. Pins can be configured to be analog inputs or digital inputs/outputs:
- Analog inputs can be used to check the status of gauges such as temperature, pressure, voltage, amperage, oil level, gas level, etc.
- Digital inputs can be used to check the ON/OFF statuses of devices or count the frequency of an event.
- Digital outputs can be used as signals to turn a device on or off based on preset values. 
- Digital signals can be used for communication with other devices. 
- Digital outputs can be configured as PWM outputs.

The SmartDisplay push button presses can be used for toggling between statuses or menus and holding the push button can be used for selecting options.

SPI, I2C, and UART communications are possible.

The Single Switch solution is useful in many applications where complex information needs to be displayed while minimizing design and installation time and complexity. Contact engineering@nkkswitches.com for application consultation.

Features:
- 36x24 pixel graphic LCD.
- Two look-up fonts. Can display 3 lines of 6 characters in font 5x7, and 2 lines of 4 characters in font 7x10.
- RGB LED backlighting for various modes of operation.
- Adjustable backlight brightness.
- Adjustable LCD contrast.
- Panel mount for easy installation.
- Single pole momentary switch.
- User configurable firmware.
- Pins available on 2x9 header (0.1”x0.1”).
- USB C connection for programming and UART communication.
- UART also available on two pins.
- Up to 14 configurable pins:
  - 9 pins are GPIO, 5 pins are input only.
  - Maximum of 9 digital outputs or PWM.
  - Maximum of 14 digital inputs.
  - Maximum of 7 ADC analog inputs.

## Applications

The IS-S0110-2 source code is available for customers to write their own programs. The source code is written in C++ using PlatformIO in Visual Studio Code. Please see the section [Programming](#programming) for more information.

Alternatively, the IS-S0110-2 source code can be configured by NKK Switches per request. Please contact engineering@nkkswitches.com for an application consultation. 

The device source code is configured per application. The user can upload images and configure what images, text, and actions they want to see. The device would then be programmed and loaded with the images, actions, and responses ready to be used. The customer would then simply need to install the device into their application. Please contact NKK Switches for any support with your application. If the current product does not meet your application, we can add features that meet your requirements.

Application Examples:  

A Single Switch Solution is hooked up to a device that drops jellybeans into a bag and a counting sensor. When the Single Switch Solution counts out a fixed number of beans it sends signals to stop the jellybeans from dropping, move the bag out of the way, seal the bag and get the next bag.  

A Single Switch Solution is used to monitor two voltages and two currents. Pressing the switch steps through displaying the status of each of the four measurements. When the voltages or currents exceed a preset warning range the display blinks to warn the operator. When the voltages or currents reach a danger range not only does the display turn red it also sends signals to shut down the system. The warning and shut down values for each measurement are user defined and can be modified by pressing and holding the switch while displaying the measurement.

A Single Switch Solution is hooked up to engine sensors to display fuel, water, oil, and temperature. Pressing the switch cycles through and displays the four statuses. When any of the statuses are outside normal the display blinks amber to warn the operator. When any of the statuses are in danger range the display blinks red. 

## How to Order

## Schematics

## Connecting to Application

All the I/O pins are directly connected to the microcontroller pin. There is no safety circuit due to lack of space. If the application signals are not stable appropriate safety measures should be implemented in the application or interface board.

- Analog Resolution: 12 bits
- Analog pin input voltage: 0 to 3.3V
- DC characteristics:
  - High-level input voltage: 2.475V to 3.6V  
  - Low-level input voltage: -0.3V to 0.825V  
  - High-level output voltage: 2.64V to 3.3V  
  - Low-level output voltage: 0V to 0.33V  
  - High-level source current: 20mA  
  - Low-level sink current: 28mA  
  - Pull-up and pull-down resistance: 45kΩ  

Some applications require an interface board for converting the analog input to proper voltage or turning on relays that require more current. NKK can design interface boards for new applications.

    Displays on power-up. Stays on for three seconds. The backlight blinks white and yellow.
</Card>

<Card title= "Battery Charge">
<image src="/assets/s0110-menu1.png"  width="150;"/>
    AN1 input is displayed as a percentage from 0% to 100%. 
    - If the percentage is greater than 50%, the backlight is green. 
    - If the percentage is 20% to 50%, the backlight is yellow. 
    - If the percentage is less than 20%, the backlight blinks red and orange. 
</Card>

<Card title="12-bit Stepper">
    <image src="/assets/s0110-menu2.png"  width="150;"/>
    AN2 input is displayed as a value from 0 to 4095 indicating the 12-bit analog resolution. A bar graph animation also updates based on the value. The backlight is cyan. The LEDs also light up based on AN2.
</Card>

<Card title="Voltmeter">

<Card title="Rotary Stepper">
    <image src="/assets/s0110-menu4.png" width="150;"/>
    AN4 input is displayed in steps from 0/16 to 16/16. The backlight is blue. 
    - If DIG1 is toggled HIGH, the step resolution increases. 
    - If DIG2 is toggled HIGH, the step resolution decreases. 
    - The step resolutions can be toggled between 4, 10, 16, 32, 50. 
    - The LEDs also light up to indicate the current step resolution.
</Card>

<Card title="Timer">

## Programming

Opening the source code:

1.	If you have purchased the IS-S0110-2, contact engineering@nkkswitches.com to receive a download for the source code. 
2.	Download Microsoft Visual Studio Code. https://code.visualstudio.com/ 
3.	Download the PlatformIO extension. 
    1. Open VSCode Extension Manager.
    2. Search for official PlatformIO IDE extension.
    3. Install PlatformIO IDE.
4.	Open the project.
    1. Under PlatformIO, select Open Project.
    2. Select the IS-S0110-2 folder.
5. Click on the Explorer to view files.
   1. Source files can be found under the “src” folder.
   2. Header files can be found under the “include” folder.
   3. The bmp_to_hex.py script can be found in the “scripts” folder. This is used to convert BMP images to hex format for the source code.

2.	The bmp_to_hex.py script can be found in the “scripts” folder.
3.	Right-click the file and select “Run Python File in terminal.” 
4.	The script will auto-populate the Images.h and Images.cpp files.
5.	Images can now be called upon in the source code per Images.h and Images.cpp.
