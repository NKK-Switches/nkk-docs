## General Features

The **Single Switch Solution** is a compact device that can both monitor and control an industrial process independently or in conjunction with other controllers.

The 36x24 pixel LCD display can display graphics or characters while the backlight color options allow for status color schemes and modes of operation. In addition to the on-board flash, capable of holding up to 64 graphic images, there are two look-up fonts (5x7 and 7x10) on board to create images based on characters. Up to 3 lines of 6 characters in font 5x7 or up to 2 lines of 4 characters in font 7x10 can be displayed.

There are twelve connections that can be digital input/output or analog input. The analog inputs can be used to check status of gauges such as temperature, pressure, voltage, amperage, oil level, gas level…etc.
The digital inputs can be used to check the ON/OFF statuses of devices or count frequency of an event.
The digital outputs can be used to signal to turn ON or OFF a device based on preset values of the inputs. 
The digital input/output can also be used for communication with another device. There can be one PWM output.
The switch presses can be used for toggling between the statuses and pressing and holding the switch can be used for setting up or selecting an option.
SPI, I2C or UART communications are possible.

**EMC/ESD compliance based on the IEC 60601-11-2:2014.**

## Applications

The Single Switch Solution is a plug and play controller/indicator device for use in an application with little to no technical or engineering know-how needed to install and operate. 

The customer would list what images, labels and actions they want to see. The device would then be programmed and preloaded with the images, actions and responses ready to be used. The customer would simply need to install the device into their application. Please contact NKK Switches with your application. If the current product does not meet your application, we can design a device to meet your requirements.

**Examples:**
- A Single Switch Solution is hooked up to a device that drops jellybeans into a bag and a counting sensor. When the Single Switch Solution counts out a fixed number of beans it sends signals to stop the jellybeans from dropping, move the bag out of the way, seal the bag and get the next bag.
- A Single Switch Solution is used to monitor two voltages and two currents. Pressing the switch steps through displaying the status of each of the four measurements. When the voltages or currents exceed a preset warning range the display blinks to warn the operator. When the voltages or currents reach a danger range not only does the display turn red it also sends signals to shut down the system. The warning and shut down values for each measurement are user defined and can be modified by pressing and holding the switch while displaying the measurement.
- A Single Switch Solution is hooked up to engine sensors to display fuel, water, oil, and temperature. Pressing the switch cycles through and displays the four statuses. When any of the statuses are outside normal the display blinks amber to warn the operator. When any of the statuses are in the danger range the display blinks red. 



## How to Order

The Single Switch Solution is custom programmed for each application, so a custom part number is assigned for each application. An evaluation kit can be ordered to get the process started. The evaluation kit part number is **IS-S0109DEM** and includes:
1. One Single Switch Solution.
2. A demonstration board that has the following features:
      - 4 potentiometers for analog input 
      - 4 switches for digital input
      - 4 LED’s for indicate status of each digital I/O 
      - The demonstration has a UART to USB converter for communication.
      - Connector for 2 pins for possible I2C firmware testing
3. A programming connector for reprogramming the Single Switch Solution (Requires a PICKIT3 from Microchip for programming).
4. A USB connection for power and communication.

<image src="/assets/IS-S0109DEM-Parts.png" width="400"/>

The evaluation kit **IS-S0109DEM** comes preprogrammed for demonstrating the Single Switch Solution capabilities. 

The information on the evaluation kit is at the end of this document.

Once the customer decides on the features required for their application, the requirements are evaluated by NKK and functional features are documented. Then they are sent for customer approval. Once approved, the firmware is written, and the custom part number is issued. The customer can place the order and receive the preprogrammed Single Switch Solution for their application. An estimate of the hours required will be determined per project. A fee estimate for the required hours will be provided for each project.

To reprogram the Single Switch Solution, a Microchip PICKIT 3 Programmer is required. Firmware is distributed via email to the customer. The evaluation kit IS-S0109DEM can also be used to reprogram the Single Switch Solution as well as for testing and verification of the new firmware.

## Backlighting

There are two backlighting states: "ON cycle" and "OFF cycle". The duration time of OFF cycle is about 500ms. The ON cycle is two times of duration of the OFF cycle. Both the duration of the OFF cycle and the multiple of the ON cycle to the OFF cycle can be specified by the customer. Each of the ON cycle and OFF cycle have 8 color option. The 64 backlight options are achieved by combination of ON cycle and OFF cycle. Additionally, 8 level of brightness are available. Below are the options for ON and OFF cycle:

Available color for ON cycle and OFF cycle:

| #   | Color   | Red | Green | Blue |
| --- | ------- | --- | ----- | ---- |
| 1   | OFF     | OFF | OFF   | OFF  |

Note: Any of I/O pins can be used as SPI.

## Connecting to Application

All the I/O pins are directly connected to the microcontroller pin. There is no safety circuit due to lack of space. If the application signals are not stable appropriate safety measures should be implemented in the application or interface board.

Analog Resolution: 10 bits  
Analog Voltage: 0 to 5V  
Digital input Voltage: Vil < 0.8V,   2V < Vih< 5V  
Digital output Voltage: Vol < 0.6V, 4.2V < Voh  

Maximum output current sourced: One I/O pin 20 mA, Total for all I/O pins 50 mA  
Maximum current sunk:  One I/O pin 20 mA, Total for all I/O pins 100 mA

Some applications require an interface board for converting the Analog input to proper voltage or turning on relays that require more current. NKK has interface boards for some application. We also entertain designing interface boards for new applications.

<Aside type="caution" title="Caution">
  Improper installation of the Single Switch Solution could damage the units.
</Aside>

The **Analog In** has four potentiometers that simulate analog input signals.

| Pin      | Function  |
| -------- | --------- |
| Analog 0 | Battery   |
| Analog 1 | 10 bits   |
| Analog 2 | Voltmeter |
| Analog 3 | Stepper   |

The **Digital In/Out** has four on/off toggles that simulate digital input signals and four LED’s that simulate digital output signals. Note that the Digital In and Digital Out are connected so the pin can only be used for one or the other. Digital 0 and 1 are used for output. Digital 2 and 3 are used for input.

| Pin       | Direction | Function                                                              |
| --------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Digital 0 | Output    | LED lit when AN0 is below warning level and higher than danger level. |

The **9-15V DC Power jack** mates with a 2.5mm cylinder power connector with a center positive.

The **Programming Connector** links the Single Switch Solution to the firmware programmer such as the PICKit 3 or 4 by Microchip. The unit must have power to program. Also, the five-pin programming bridge should be installed into the 5x1 female header, so the unit is connected to the Single Switch Solution. It should be removed after programming to prevent stray signals.

## Programming

### 1.	Preparing the IS-S0109DEM for Programming

The Programming Connector links the Single Switch Solution to the firmware programmer such as the PICKit 3 by Microchip.

1.	The unit must have power to program.
2.	The five-pin programming bridge should be installed into the 5x1 female header, so the unit is connected to the Single Switch Solution. It should be removed after programming to prevent stray signals. Make sure there is contact between the connector and pads on the bottom of the S0109.
3.	Pin one on the programmer must be connected to pin one on the programming connector. Plugging it in wrong may damage the unit or the programmer or both.

**Common Errors:**
1.	Target device was not found (could not detect target voltage VDD). You must connect to a target device to use PICkit 3.
      - Check that the connections are attached. Wiggle the S0109 around.
2.	Target Device ID (0x0) is an Invalid Device ID. Please check your connections to the Target Device.
      - Wiggle the S0109 around. Make sure the programming connection has proper contact.

### 4. Testing

1.	Unplug power plug.
2.	Remove PICkit 3 from unit.
3.	Remove Single Switch Solution from the IS-S0109DEM board.
4.	Remove programming bridge.
5.	Plug in Single Switch Solution back onto IS-S0109DEM board.

6.	Plug in power plug.
7.	Adjust analog pots, IS pushbutton, and digital switches as necessary to verify that the unit is working as expected.

**Notes:**
- If any of the analog pins are used as digital output, make sure the corresponding potentiometer is in a middle position while programming. 
- If the pins are assigned as digital OUT and the potentiometer is all the away to one side or the other, it may cause damage to the unit.
- If the pins are assigned as digital IN the potentiometer should not be left to produce voltage between 0.6V to 2V.
