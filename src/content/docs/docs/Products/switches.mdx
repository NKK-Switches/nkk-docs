description: Learn how to use a dropdown menu to switch between topics in your Starlight website.
---

This package exposes a dropdown menu component meant to be used as a [custom topic list](https://starlight-sidebar-topics.netlify.app/docs/guides/custom-topic-list/) for the [Starlight Sidebar Topics](https://starlight-sidebar-topics.netlify.app/) plugin.

:::tip[See it in action]
At the top of the sidebar, you can find the dropdown menu in action to switch between the different topics used in this documentation, such as "Documentation" and "Demo" that each have their own sidebar configuration, while the "Starlight Docs" topic is a direct link to the Starlight documentation.
:::

## Prerequisites

You will need to have a Starlight website set up.
If you don't have one yet, you can follow the ["Getting Started"](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started) guide in the Starlight docs to create one.

You will also need to have the [Starlight Sidebar Topics](https://starlight-sidebar-topics.netlify.app/) plugin installed and configured.
If you don't have it set up yet, you can follow the ["Getting Started"](https://starlight-sidebar-topics.netlify.app/getting-started) guide in the Starlight Sidebar Topics docs.

## Installation

import { Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';


You can also render the dropdown menu in a different location in your website by overriding different components.
Lean more about [overriding components](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/overriding-components/) in the Starlight docs.

The components reference is a collection of all the components that Ion provides. If you like Ion but want to change a specific component, you can use the source code here to create your own custom component. These docs are generated from the source code, so they are always up-to-date. 

If you don't know how to override components, check out [Starlight's guide on overriding components](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/overriding-components/).
