This page will explain how to use the onboard program creator. To get started you will need to have one of our Wi-Fi enabled products and access the on board we portal. 

<Aside>This guide is only for our Wi-Fi enabled product line. For non Wi-Fi devices and more detailed device information and guides, please go to the respective page for that product.</Aside>

## Connecting to the device

<Steps>

1. Connect to the access point. By Default this is a open network and will have no internet connection. XXXX will represent a unique number for each device. 

   <Tabs syncKey="S0110">

   <TabItem label="S0110">

   ```sh
	SSID: NSA-S0110-XXXX
   ```

   </TabItem>

   <TabItem label="CU6401">

	```sh
	SSID: NSA-CU6401-XXXX
   ```

   </TabItem>

   </Tabs>

2. Once the device has successfully connected, open your browser and connect to the ondevice portal.
	<Tabs syncKey="S0110">

   <TabItem label="S0110">

   ```sh
	http://nsa-s0110.local/
   ```

   </TabItem>

   <TabItem label="CU6401">

	```sh
	http://nsa-cu6401.local/
   ```

   </TabItem>

   </Tabs>

3. After the page connects you will be greated with the login page.

<Aside type="caution"> In the event the ondevice portal does not show up after typing in the URL, please verify you are still connected to the local network.</Aside>

## Prerequisites

You will need to have a Starlight website set up.
If you don't have one yet, you can follow the ["Getting Started"](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started) guide in the Starlight docs to create one.

You will also need to have the [Starlight Sidebar Topics](https://starlight-sidebar-topics.netlify.app/) plugin installed and configured.
If you don't have it set up yet, you can follow the ["Getting Started"](https://starlight-sidebar-topics.netlify.app/getting-started) guide in the Starlight Sidebar Topics docs.

## Installation



You can also render the dropdown menu in a different location in your website by overriding different components.
Lean more about [overriding components](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/overriding-components/) in the Starlight docs.

The components reference is a collection of all the components that Ion provides. If you like Ion but want to change a specific component, you can use the source code here to create your own custom component. These docs are generated from the source code, so they are always up-to-date. 

If you don't know how to override components, check out [Starlight's guide on overriding components](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/overriding-components/).
