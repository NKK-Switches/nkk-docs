This page will explain how to use the onboard program creator. To get started you will need to have one of our Wi-Fi enabled products and access the on board we portal.

   ```sh
	SSID: NSA-S0110-XXXX
   ```

   </TabItem>

   <TabItem label="CU6401">

	```sh
	SSID: NSA-CU6401-XXXX
   ```

   </TabItem>

   </Tabs>

2. Once the device has successfully connected, open your browser and connect to the ondevice portal.
	<Tabs syncKey="S0110">

   <TabItem label="S0110">

   ```sh
	http://nsa-s0110.local/
   ```

   </TabItem>

   <TabItem label="CU6401">

	```sh
	http://nsa-cu6401.local/
