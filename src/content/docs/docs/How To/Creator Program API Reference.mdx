## Inputs
<Image src="/assets/input.png" />

The input block will define all inputs that will be needed for your device. The input block will take 4 parameters that are required. &#x20;

| Parameter | Input description                                                        | Default Value |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------- |
| Name      | The human readable comment of the input.                                 | in1           |
| Pin       | The pin number that the input will represent.                            | 0             |
| Type      | The type of input. Either analog or digital.                             | analog        |
| Pull      | Either pull up or pull down. If no pull is needed, use DNP (Do Not Pull) | DNP           |

## Outputs
<Image src="/assets/output.png" />

The output block will define all the outputs that will be needed for your device. The output block will take 3 parameters that are required to create a valid output. The output block will fit inside of the input block and will take states and conditions blocks will fit inside.  When PWM is selected the output block will require a channel and frequency input as well.&#x20;

| Parameter | Input description                                                                  | Default Value |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |

| Pin       | The pin number that the output will represent.                                     | -1            |
| Type      | The type of output. Either digital or PWM.                                         | digital       |
| Channel   | PWM channel to use if type is set to PWM. There are 10 channels available for use. | 1             |
| Frequency | The frequency in Hz of the PWM channel if type is set to PWM.                      | 1000          |

## States & Conditions

### State

<Image src="/assets/state.png" />

The state block is a general block to set or show the state of the switch element. A maximum of 10 states can exist per output. For example, states are used to change images or text on the LCD, change the backlight color, drive the I/O pins, operate timers, change flag variables, etc. &#x20;

### Condition

<Image src="/assets/condition.png" />

The condition block is used to set conditions. A maximum of 10 conditions can exist per output. There are multiple options for conditions such as reading the switch press, pins, timers, and flags. &#x20;

States and conditions are numbered state1, state2, etc. When the conditions in condition1 are satisfied, state1 activates. A condition triggers when all the options are satisfied. 

Example: For an output:  
State 1 is changing the backlight green.  
State 2 is changing the backlight red.  
Condition 1 is when the switch is pressed.  
Condition 2 is when pin 14 is HIGH and pin 15 is LOW.  
Therefore, when the switch is pressed, the backlight turns green. When both pin 14 is HIGH and pin 15 is LOW, the backlight turns red.

## State Options

### Timer

<Image src="/assets/timer_action.png" />

Operates a timer. There are 8 different timers available for use. The actions are:
* Start - When a timer is started, it counts down from its set duration.
* Stop - When stopped, the timer is set to 0.
* Restart - Restarts the timer with its set duration.
* Pause - Pauses a timer.
* Resume - Resumes a timer if paused. 

<Image src="/assets/timer_duration.png" />

The value in milliseconds to set a timer when it is started. 

<Image src="/assets/timer_operation.png" />

Operation to modify a timer's duration in milliseconds. The options are:
* = , sets the duration to a specific value.
* += , add a value to the duration.
* -= , subtract a value from the duration.

### Flag

<Image src="/assets/flag_action.png" />

Flags are integer variables that can be modified and read. There are 12 flags available for use. The options are:
* = , sets the flag to a specific value.
* += , add a value to a flag.
* -= , subtract a value from a flag.
* ++ , increment the flag value by 1.
* -- , decrement tht flag value by 1.

### Images

<Image src="/assets/image.png" />

Displays an image from the path on the flash storage. To upload more images please see the [getting started](/docs/how-to/getting-started-with-wifi-products/) guide. 

### Output

<Image src="/assets/output_pin.png" />

Sets the state of the output pin LOW or HIGH. The output "type" must be set to "digital".

### Duty

<Image src="/assets/duty.png" />

Sets the duty cycle of the PWM channel if the output "type" is set to "PWM".

### On Duration

<Image src="/assets/on_duration.png" />

Sets the pin HIGH for the set duration, overrides the "output" block and "PWM" setting.

### Off Duration

<Image src="/assets/off_duration.png" />

Sets the pin LOW for the set duration, overrides the "output" block and "PWM" setting.

### Clear Background

<Image src="/assets/clear_background.png" />

Clears the pixels before putting text or images. Don't use if you want text to superimpose over previous pixels.

### Set Text

<Image src="/assets/text.png" />

Sets text to rows 1, 2, or 3 on the switch. If row 3 is selected, the font will be 6x8.

### Font

<Image src="/assets/font.png" />

Sets the font size for text. There are two sizes: 6x8 and 9x12. 6x8 can fit six characters per row in three rows. 9x12 can fit four characters per row in two rows.

### Invert

### Set Color

<Image src="/assets/color.png" />

Sets the backlight to a static color.

<Image src="/assets/color_on_off.png" />
