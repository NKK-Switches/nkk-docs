## Inputs
<Image src="/assets/input.png" />

The input block will define all inputs that will be needed for your device. The input block will take 4 parameters that are required. &#x20;

| Parameter | Input description                                                        | Default Value |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------- |
| Name      | The human readable comment of the input.                                 | in1           |
| Pin       | The pin number that the input will represent.                            | 0             |
| Type      | The type of input. Either analog or digital.                             | analog        |
| Pull      | Either pull up or pull down. If no pull is needed, use DNP (Do Not Pull) | DNP           |

## Outputs
<Image src="/assets/output.png" />

The output block will define all the outputs that will be needed for your device. The output block will take 3 parameters that are required to create a valid output. The output block will fit inside of the input block and will take states and conditions blocks will fit inside.  When PWM is selected, the output block will require a channel and frequency input as well.&#x20;

| Parameter | Input description                                                                  | Default Value |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Name      | The human readable comment of the output.                                          | out1          |
| Pin       | The output pin to drive. Select -1 for no output pin to be driven.                 | -1            |
| Type      | The type of output. Either digital or PWM.                                         | digital       |
| Channel   | PWM channel to use if type is set to PWM. There are 10 channels available for use. | 1             |
| Frequency | The frequency in Hz of the PWM channel if type is set to PWM.                      | 1000          |

 If the pin number is -1, the "type", "channel", and "frequency" fields have no effect. If a pin number is selected and the type is digital, the "channel" and "frequency" fields have no effect.

## States & Conditions

<div style={{ display: "flex", gap: "16px", alignItems: "center" }}>
<Image src="/assets/state.png" />
<Image src="/assets/condition.png" />
</div>

The state blocks are used to perform device actions. The condition blocks are used to set conditions to operate the device. State and condition blocks are placed within output blocks and are numbered state1, state2, condition1, condition2, etc. A maximum of 10 states and conditions can exist per output.

When the conditions in condition1 are satisfied, state1 activates. A condition triggers when all the options are satisfied. 

States are used to change images or text on the LCD, change the backlight color, drive the I/O pins, operate timers, change flag variables, etc. 

There are multiple options for conditions such as reading the switch press, pins, timers, and flags. 

For example, an output is configured as follows:  
- State 1 is changing the backlight green.  
- State 2 is changing the backlight red.  
- Condition 1 is when the switch is pressed.  
- Condition 2 is when the switch is held and pin 14 is HIGH.  

Therefore, when the switch is pressed, the backlight turns green. When both pin 14 is HIGH and the switch is held, the backlight turns red.

## State Options

### Timer

<Image src="/assets/timer_action.png" />

Operates a timer. There are 8 different timers available for use. The actions are:
* Start - When a timer is started, it counts down from its set duration.
* Stop - When stopped, the timer is set to 0.
* Restart - Restarts the timer with its set duration.
* Pause - Pauses a timer.
* Resume - Resumes a timer if paused. 

<Image src="/assets/timer_duration.png" />

The value in milliseconds to set a timer when it is started. 

<Image src="/assets/timer_operation.png" />

Operation to modify a timer's duration in milliseconds. The options are:
* = , sets the duration to a specific value.
* += , add a value to the duration.
* -= , subtract a value from the duration.

### Flag

<Image src="/assets/flag_action.png" />

Flags are integer variables that can be modified and read. There are 12 flags available for use. The options are:
* = , sets the flag to a specific value.
* += , add a value to a flag.
* -= , subtract a value from a flag.
* ++ , increment the flag value by 1.
* -- , decrement tht flag value by 1.

### Images

<Image src="/assets/image.png" />

Type the name of the image only. If the image name is not found on the flash switch, you will receive an error code. Please see the product page for the correct error code. 

### Output

<Image src="/assets/output_pin.png" />

Sets the output pin defined in the output block either LOW or HIGH. The output "type" must be set to "digital" for this functionality to work.

### Duty

<Image src="/assets/duty.png" />

Sets the duty cycle in Hz of the PWM channel associated with the output pin defined in the output block. The output "type" must be set to "PWM" for this functionality to work.

### On Duration

<Image src="/assets/on_duration.png" />

Sets the output pin HIGH for the set duration in ms. If this block is used, it will override using the "output" and "duty" state blocks.

### Off Duration

<Image src="/assets/off_duration.png" />

Sets the output pin LOW for the set duration in ms. If this block is used, it will override using the "output" and "duty" state blocks.

### Clear Background

<Image src="/assets/clear_background.png" />

Clears the pixels before putting text or images. Don't use if you want text to superimpose over previous pixels.

### Set Text

<Image src="/assets/text.png" />

Sets text to rows 1, 2, or 3 on the switch. If row 3 is selected, the font will be 6x8.

### Font

<Image src="/assets/font.png" />

Sets the font size for text. There are two sizes: 6x8 and 9x12. 6x8 can fit six characters per row in three rows. 9x12 can fit four characters per row in two rows.

### Invert

<Image src="/assets/invert.png" />

Inverts the pixels of the text or image placed.

### Set Color

<Image src="/assets/color.png" />

Sets the backlight to a static color.

<Image src="/assets/color_on_off.png" />

Sets two alternating and blinking colors. The duration of each color is set. This option overrides the "color" block. Durations are in milliseconds.

### Brightness

<Image src="/assets/brightness.png" />

Sets the backlight brightness from levels 1-10. The default level is 10.

### Contrast

<Image src="/assets/contrast.png" />

Sets the LCD contrast or the darkness of the pixels from levels 1-10. The default level is 7. It is not necessary to change the contrast. Adjusting the contrast is only needed if you see changes in the display due to extreme temperatures.

### Stopwatch

<Image src="/assets/stopwatch.png" />

Operates the stopwatch. The stopwatch is the length of time the unit has been on since power-up. The stopwatch can be seen with the display stopwatch block. The actions to operate the stopwatch are:
- Start - When the stopwatch is started, it begins counting up. The stopwatch automatically starts on power-up.
- Stop - When stopped, the stopwatch is set to 0. The stopwatch is reset when the unit is powered off.
- Pause - Pauses the stopwatch.
- Resume - Resumes the stopwatch if paused.

### Display Analog Value

<Image src="/assets/display_analog.png" />

Displays an analog reading from a pin on the LCD. Data can be displayed in various formats:     

* Display Analog Voltage: converts and shows the reading as a voltage from 0-3.3V.
* Display Analog Percent: converts and shows the reading as a value from 0-100%.
* Display Analog BarGraph: converts and shows the reading as a bar graph animation in one row.
* Display Analog Fraction: converts and shows the reading as a fraction. The "levels" field sets the denominator or number of steps.
* Display Analog Value: shows the raw 12-bit analog value from 0-4095.

### Display Timer

<Image src="/assets/display_timer.png" />
